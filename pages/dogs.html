      <p>
        The Labrador Retriever or simply Labrador is a British breed of
        retriever gun dog.<br />
        It was developed in the United Kingdom from fishing dogs imported from
        the colony of Newfoundland (now a province of Canada),
        <br />
        and was named after the Labrador region of that colony. <br />It is
        among the most commonly kept dogs in several countries,
        <br />particularly in the Western world.
